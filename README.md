# BullyAlgorithm
A conceptual python implementation of the bully algorithm which is an election algorithm
he code doesnt actually implement bully to the lower levels such as RPC and socket communication but 
it shows how a live algorithm should be working.Instead of different processes on the network, this uses functions.
